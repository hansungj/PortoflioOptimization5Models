# PortoflioOptimization5Models

The goal of this project was to form portfolios using five different variations of Mean-Variance Optimization(MVO), as well as Conditonal Value at Risk(CVaR) with Monte Carlo. We analysed different investment strategies on 20 stocks U.S. S&P500 between 2012 and 2015.

The five models are:
1. MVO
2. Robust MVO
3. Resampling MVO
4. Most-Diverse MVO
5. Conditional Value at Risk
